Telepathy-Mixer is a [Telepathy](http://telepathy.freedesktop.org/) connection manager for the MXit protocol.

This allows users to connect to the MXit service using clients like [Empathy](http://live.gnome.org/Empathy) on Linux.

As Telepathy is written for Linux, we do not current support Windows. A Pidgin plugin for MXit exists for both Linux and Windows, see [Pidgin-MXit](https://launchpad.net/pidgin-mxit/).

For support, please use the [telepathy-mixer](http://groups.google.com/group/telepathy-mixer) Google Group.
